About
=====

* create a Python dictionary of AVR instructions

    * :key: instruction pneumonic
    * :value: number of clock cycles
    * for instructions with variable numbers of cycles, use the maximum number
      of cycles

* parse the ``.avra`` file (the disassembly output):

    * for each line of assembly
    * extract the instruction
    * append it to a list of instructions

* use the dictionary to look up the number of clock cycles for each instruction
  in the list

    * for each instruction in the list
    * look up the number of cycles
    * append it to a list of cycles

* sum the list of cycles to calculate the total number of cycles consumed by the
  assembly code listed in the ``.avra`` file
